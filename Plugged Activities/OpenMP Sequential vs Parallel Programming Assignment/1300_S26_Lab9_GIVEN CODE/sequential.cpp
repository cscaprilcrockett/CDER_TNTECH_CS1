	Description: 	A program that computes runtime to read in words 
					from a text file, prepend the number of characters
					in the word to each word, and then sort the words
					in ascending order.

				the Vector push_back function.  push_back adds one new element
				at the end of the vector and places the argument sent to 
				the push_back function in that new element.

	Purpose:  The purpose of this function is just to print all vector
	elements with a comma between each piece of data.
	
	The only reason to call this function in this program is just to 
	test if the vector was actually sorted. When you are timing the
	program running, however, you will not want to call this function.

	Function: bubbleSort
	Purpose:
	Sorts a vector of strings in ascending alphabetical order
