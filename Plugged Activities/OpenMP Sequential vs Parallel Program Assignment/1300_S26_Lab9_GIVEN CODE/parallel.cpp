				the Vector push_back function.  push_back adds one new element
				at the end of the vector and places the argument sent to 
				the push_back function in that new element.

	Purpose:  The purpose of this function is just to print all vector
	elements with a comma between each piece of data.
	
	The only reason to call this function in this program is just to 
	test if the vector was actually sorted. When you are timing the
	program running, however, you will not want to call this function.

/*
	Function: parallelBubbleSort()
	
	NOTE: DO NOT MODIFY THIS FUNCTION!!
	
	Purpose: The parallelBubbleSort function is really called "Odd Even Transposition Sort" or "Brick Sort" which is an altered version of 
	bubble sort in order to parallelize the sorting. In this algorithm we
	alternately swap the even items with their next item for one pass,
	and then the odd items with their next time for the next pass.
	It is similar to shaker sort. This algorithm lends itself well to
	parallelisation because all of the compare-and-swap operations in
	each pass could theoretically be performed at once.
	on a vector of strings using OpenMP to accelerate the process by taking 
	advantage of multiple CPU threads.

				The line below #pragma omp for reduction(||:swapped)

					-"reduction" causes each thread to get a private copy of swapped
					-Each thread works independently and updates its own private copy
					-At the end of the parallel region (end of the for loop), OpenMP combines 
					      all the private copies using the operator specified (in this case, || = logical OR)
					-If any thread sets its swapped to true, the final shared swapped becomes true

				If you changed the line below to just #pragma omp for (removing reduction(||:swapped)
				then every thread modifies the shared variable swapped directly, 
				which can cause:
					-Race conditions (multiple threads trying to write to swapped at the same time)
					-False sharing and cache coherence issues
					-Overhead from synchronizing writes to shared memory
				This slows things down and creates unpredictable behavior.
