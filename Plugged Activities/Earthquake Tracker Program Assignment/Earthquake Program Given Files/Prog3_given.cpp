				(can also be used with HTML pages, etc).
				
				It writes downloaded data into a C++ ostream (like ofstream or cout).
				
	Parameters: -void* contents is a pointer to the block of memory containing 
				 the data received by libcurl
				-size_t size and size_t nmemb specifiy the total size of the 
				 data (actual size is size*nmemb)
				-ostream* userp is a pointer to an output stream (such as a file 
				 stream or string stream where the received data should be written.
