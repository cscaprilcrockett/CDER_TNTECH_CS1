	Purpose:  	The main function is in this file.
	
				Concept: The program simulates a group of sea turtle hatchlings 
				trying to reach the ocean. The program does the following:
					-Gets the number of hatchlings.
					-Simulates each one's progress.
					-Calculates survival chances based on environmental conditions.

				It uses:
					-Loops to simulate each hatchling's journey.
					-Branching to handle different environmental conditions.
					-Calculations to estimate survival rates.
					
				For more information on header files, GeeksforGeeks
				has a good article:
